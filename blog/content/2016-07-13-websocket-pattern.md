Title: A Pattern for Websockets in Python
Category: engineering
Status: published
Summary: Using long polling and other workarounds to deal with
         long-running tasks is less than optimal.  We explore a
         pattern for easy deployment of WebSockets in Python web
         applications, through the combination of various
         micro-services.

*This post is part of a series of articles on the infrastructure
underlying [cesium](http://cesium-ml.org).  Please send us your feedback
in the comments section below.*

## Motivation

Traditionally, web frontends communicate with backends via API
requests.  For example, to add a new user, the frontend would make an
asynchronous Javascript (AJAX) POST to `/create_user`.  The request
returns with a status and some data, which the frontend relays to the
user as appropriate.

These types of calls are designed for short-lived request-answer
sessions: the answer has to come back before the connection times out,
otherwise the frontend is responsible for implementing logic for
recovery.  When the backend has to deal with a longer running task,
the frontend typically polls repeatedly to see when it is done.

Another common scenario is one where the server wants to push updates
through to clients as they become available.  E.g., the server may
scan a news resource once an hour, and then publish the results to all
connected clients.  The traditional solution is to either
[use long polling or SSEs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/).

Both of the above situations can be handled gracefully using
WebSockets---the caveat being that these can be intimidating to set
up, especially in Python.

This article presents a simple recipe for adding WebSocket support to
your Python web server.  It works with any WSGI server (Flask, Django,
Pylons, etc.), and allows scaling up as demand increases.  The full
source code is available online at
[https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow).

Our end goal is to provide a pattern through which implementation of a
data flow model such as [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
becomes trivial.  Information always flows in one direction: from
frontend to backend via API calls, and from backend to frontend via
WebSocket communication.

## Building blocks

The following diagram shows the different components of the system:

![Message Flow Layout]({attach}images/cesium_message_flow.png)

There are two primary server pools: web servers, and web socket
servers.  The web servers can be any WSGI compatible server,
e.g. Flask, Django, Pyramid, etc.  The WebSocket server consists of
[105 lines of code](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow/blob/master/websocket_server.py),
and runs on top of
[Tornado's WebSocket implementation](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/websocket.html).

We run both these services behind an
[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) proxy, which redirects
any requests to `/websocket` to the WebSocket pool and the rest to the
Flask app (running on a Unix socket).

To allow communication between web servers and WebSocket servers, a
[ZeroMq](http://zeromq.org/) XPUB-XSUB pipeline is established (this
is a very simple form of a message broker, and comprises a mere
[20 lines of code](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow/blob/master/message_proxy.py)).

The frontend connects to the backend using a
[reconnecting WebSocket](https://github.com/joewalnes/reconnecting-websocket).
To ensure that users cannot listen to one another's communications,
each frontend client receives a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/).
This token is then sent to the WebSocket for authentication.  This
logic requires about
[80 lines of JavaScript](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow/blob/master/static/js/websocket.js)
and
[3 lines of Python](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow/blob/master/flask_app.py#L80).

To keep the different micro-services up and running, we use
[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/).

As you can see, each individual component is

- extremely simple and
- does only the one thing it was designed for.

Debugging is easy: all log files are saved together in ``./log``.

Horizontal scaling is a only matter of launching more servers.  This
is true for all services except the current message proxy
implementation, which can easily
[be replaced with RabbitMQ](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/products/rabbitmq-hits-one-million-messages-per-second-on-google-compute-engine).

## Technical lessons learnt

There are a few technical gotchas to be aware of when implementing
this pattern:

- Behind nginx, open connections time out after one minute.  We send
  heartbeat packets every 45 seconds to keep the connection open.

- Supervisord has not been released for Python 3 yet.  This is not a
  problem, since we're only using it as a process controller.  Just
  launch it using Python 2 irrespective of the version used for the
  rest of your code.

- Python tasks do not always flush output to standard out rapidly
  enough for it to be caught in log files.  In our
  ``supervisord.conf``, we set ``PYTHONBUFFERED=1`` to make sure our
  log files are filled.

- Not all systems allow opening Unix sockets in arbitrary locations.

## Adopting this pattern

Try our
[example application](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow) or
adopt this pattern in your own code as follows:

- Modify your existing web application to have an API endpoint
   `/socket_auth_token`.  This endpoint should return:

```python
jwt.encode({'username': get_username()}, app_secret_key)
```

- Include ``reconnecting-websocket`` and ``websocket.js`` (from our
  repository) in your HTML header:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reconnecting-websocket/1.0.0/reconnecting-websocket.min.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/websocket.js"></script>

```

- Modify your landing page to have `connected` and `authenticated` divs:

```html
<ul>
  <li><b>WebSocket Connection: </b><span id="connected">Offline</span></li>
  <li><b>WebSocket Authenticated: </b><span id="authenticated">No</span></li>
</ul>

```

- Implement a basic event handler in your landing page to take care
of incoming messages on the WebSocket:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  function messageHandler(data) {
    switch (data["id"]) {
      case "EXAMPLE ID":
        /* Do something when a message with "EXAMPLE ID" arrives */
        console.log('EXAMPLE ID spotted');
        break;
      default:
        console.log('Unknown message ' + JSON.stringify(data) + ' arrived');
      }
  };
</script>
```

And hook it up:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function() {
    ws = createSocket("ws://" + {{ request.host|tojson|safe }} + "/websocket",
                      messageHandler
    );
  }
<script type="text/javascript">
```

- Messages are relayed to the frontend by [publishing them onto the message
  queue](https://github.com/cesium-ml/message_flow/blob/master/flask_app.py#L33).

- Copy the following services and config files from our repository:

    - Makefile
    - supervisord.conf
    - nginx.conf
    - message_proxy.py
    - websocket_server.py

Edit `supervisord.conf` to launch your webapp on `run/flask_app.sock`.

- Launch!

Type `make` and watch the fireworks.

## Future work

Our next goal is to implement syncing of frontend and backend state,
with the ultimate purpose of implementing Flux with React components.
This is easy in Javascript with isomorphic applications, but harder
when the backend is running Python.

Please let us know what you think of this pattern in the comments
section below.  We'd love to learn how to do it better!
